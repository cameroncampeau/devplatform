# File Explorer
This was a standalone app I built to get more experience working with filesystems. It allows users to browse through the server filesystem in a web interface.

**Note**: This app is NOT secure. It was built only as a POC and learning opportunity. 



## Setup
The app can be started with following command:
```
node app.js
```

To build the VueJS frontend run:
```
cd public
npm run build
```
