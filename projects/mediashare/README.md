# MediaShare
I built this app to be a simple Netflix-like interface for locally stored movies. My goal for this project was to get experience working with HTML5 videos, but I ended up expanding the project's scope to include backend processing of movies to extract thumnbnails. Due to the focus being on working with videos, the frontend is otherwise very basic and written in vanilla JS. 


## Setup
The app can be started with following command:
```
node app.js
```
